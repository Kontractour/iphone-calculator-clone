# 📱 iPhone Calculator Clone (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

A responsive, pixel-perfect iPhone calculator clone built using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.
This project accurately replicates the native iOS calculator in design, layout, and functionality, and also showcases my ability to recreate real-world interfaces and implement precise JavaScript logic.
